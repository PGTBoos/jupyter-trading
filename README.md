Trading with python and jupyter

The jupyter notebooks here, are for your viewing pleasure.
If you can improve them go ahead, update through Git.

If your unfamiliar, if you get problems because your python environment isnt working.
Ea Tensorflow / pytorch or whatever problem with these notebooks.
Dont ask for help here, sorry.. there are just better places for that, try stackoverflow or a python forum.
I just dont have time to answer lots of emails, as people have interest in trading algo's.

The code here started from: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhrCz6t7rmQ&t=335s

instead of issues you can add improving comments, i might read those.
i'm slightly worried putting this here will result in lots of questions for which i have no time to answer, its spare time coding for me.


## I'm aware of :
- Currently these traders dont actually trade yet
- I have not yet a good formula to decide when to trade, (what is the right moment to buy).
  Idealy a neural net must learn unsupervised the best moment for buying / selling 
  Thus training it over lots of time periods.. not to predict the next Close, but to totaal MAX GAIN  is something different.
- For the later input is welcome.
